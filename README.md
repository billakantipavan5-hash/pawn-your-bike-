Pawn Your Bike (PUB)

📖<b>*Project Description*</b>

Pawn Your Bike (PUB) is a web-based mini project inspired by platforms like OLX, designed to provide an emergency finance solution through digital bike pawning.
Instead of selling a bike permanently, users can pawn their bike or vehicle to get instant short-term loans while retaining ownership.

The platform connects borrowers and pawnbrokers in a simple, user-friendly interface where users can post their bike details, calculate loan interest, communicate through chat, and request pawn approval.
